# About

This repo is a scratchpad for the files and lessons learned from [Mastering Node.js, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Node-js-server-side-applications-efficiently-ebook/dp/B078MNXC78).

## Motivation

I learn by writing and blowing things up. All of my repositories that start with the word "learnings" are from tutorials or books I have read.

## Goals for Project

-   documenting things I learned so I can use them as resource later
-   Introduction to mocha testing
-   general awesomeness in Node development

## Lessons Learned
